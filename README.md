# Structured-Data-Fromat
Here I converted an input CSV file containing employee data into a structured format representing historical records of employee compensation, engagement, and performance reviews using Python. 

#Documentation
1. For End Date and Effective Data imported datetime
2. As said for last record of employee considered far future data (2100-01-01) as End date
3. Transfomed data based on rows present 
4. Date columns are expected to be in a consistent format and are converted to datetime objects for sorting and manipulation.
5. No additional data validation or cleaning is performed assuming the input data is clean and valid.
